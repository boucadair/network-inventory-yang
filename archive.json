And for the MPO/break out cable, i am also agree to have a list of destination to describe the multiple breakout ports. And for those ports which there is no transceiver plugged-in, the port still need to be provided in inventory.  We also agree that there could be multiple network elements on a rack. For the site's definition, i am not quite sure, but i also agree that site and equipment room can be both optional.\r\n\r\nChenfang: I have some other understanding for MPO port.

There could be some configuration requirement for NE/board/port name, location, description, alias, etc. An alternative way to support these configuration is configuring from network topology data model, but there are two things we need to consider more:\r\n(1) A NE/port could be multiple nodes/TPs in different layers of topology, it is not quite convenient to modify all the nodes/TPs.\r\n(2) Board object is not defined in network topology data model and there could be some other configuration requirement besides name, location, description, alias, E.G. board's working mode .etc.\r\n3. Another alternative way to support configuration function is configuring through ietf-hardware data model in RFC8348.  But it is still not able to support configuration for equipment room, rack and NE, because hardware data model is a NE-level data model.",

The model does not yet cover some physical aspects such as connectors, cables, strands and physical spans. We have some work that may be helpful in TAPI. We should avoid broad physical modeling such as geographic structures etc.\r\n\r\nthe ability to hot-swap and to deal with other dynamics should be considered in this model.\r\n\r\nOther characteristics such as height, length, width, weight etc. may be best handled in a spec layer. This needs to be discussed in some details. This also applies to the humidity characteristics, fire characteristics, power rating, thermal ratings, physical stress and mechanical vibration characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe model intentionally does not cover functional aspects. We should work on the relationship between functional and physical. The functional model relationship needs to deal with \"equipment protections\" which is really functional protections. ONF have some work that may help here.\r\n\r\nThere are a few cases of mechanical functionality (such as a fan). This could be covered here (e.g., the property fan-speed could be a valid augment to a module that has a fan.\r\n\r\nThe model of temperature, humidity and other environmental aspects (especially when measured) relate closely and should be considered carefully.\r\n\r\nThe model of power is unusual in that it is narrow functional. There is a flow etc. The relationship between this model and power  needs to be considered carefully. Power is not physical but from the perspective of the other functions it is essentially the motive force. There is no detailed model of power. In other bodies, power is \"smunged\" into the physical model.  This needs to be considered very carefully.\r\n\r\nThe model of software is complex and should be separate from the model of the physical solution.\r\n\r\nState machines associated with the power-up cycle, admin state etc. really related to the functional model and should be considered carefully.",

This enables providing federated datastores with a holistic network view without the need for redundant models and copies of the same data across different systems.  Such a capability could become of interest in the future should increasing amounts of management data need to be integrated with network inventory data, for example current state of inventoried elements, data about interfaces, etc.  \r\n\r\nThe proposal was overall well-received, with several attendees contributing to the discussion, involving questions related to scalability, differences between peer-mount and schema-mount, instantiation vs modeling issues.  A 00 draft is in the works and Alex stated that the authors of Peer-Mount are looking for potential coauthors.  \r\n",
